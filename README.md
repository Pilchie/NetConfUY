## Building C# Analyzers and Quick Fixes  with "Roslyn"
In this hands-on workshop, you'll build a custom compiler diagnostic for C# that runs automatically as the user types code, as well as when the compiler runs on the command line.
Next, you'll learn how to distribute your diagnostic via NuGet, and finally how to plug in to Visual Studio 2015 to add a custom "Quick Fix".

See the `UseNameof` directory for the source code I presented.

## Modern day C# development in Visual Studio "15"
Come see what's in the pipeline for C# developers in Visual Studio "15".  In this fast-paced, demo filled session, Kevin will take a lap around new features.
From a fast, low-impact setup, to improvements in editing, navigation, and refactoring, to additional quick fixes and more support for enforcing code style,
there's a lot to look forward to.

See [xunit.runner.wpf](https://github.com/Pilchie/xunit.runner.wpf) for the code I edited during the presentation.
